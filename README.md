Some initial experiments with edge effects for AOHs. In this repo I have

* aoh.py - a straight simple AOH implementation
* aohedge.py - a simple binary edge effect implementation that removes one pixel from the edges
* aohfractionaledge.py - allows between 0.0 and 1.0 of a pixel to be defined as an edge
* findedges.py - a script that shows which pixels are edges in a raster
